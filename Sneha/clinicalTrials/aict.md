2.3 Data Processing:
- The study focused on classifying healthcare AI technologies, disease areas, and healthcare application scenarios.
- AI technologies were classified into reasoning and decision-making, learning and perception, and integration (robotics).
- Disease areas and healthcare application scenarios were manually classified based on trial information.

2.4 Statistical Analysis:
- Descriptive analysis was used to analyze the trial characteristics.
- Categorical variables were reported as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables as median and interquartile ranges.
- Stratification and statistical tests were conducted to compare proportions.
- Logistic regression models were used to identify independent risk factors associated with reporting results.

3.1 Characteristics of the Included Trials:
- A total of 1725 trials were included, with 43.01% being interventional trials and 56.99% being observational trials.
- Among the interventional trials, 26.14% were completed, 41.57% were in the process of recruiting, and 18.72% were not recruiting.
- Most trials did not mention the phases of the trials.
- Among the observational trials, the majority were cohort studies (60.43%).

3.2 Overview of AI Technology Applications in AI-Related Trials:
- Machine Learning (ML) was the most applied technology, with 57.62% of the studies using ML algorithms, particularly Neural Networks (NN) and Deep Learning (DL).
- Visual perception and language understanding algorithms were used in 4.52% and 3.42% of the studies, respectively.
- Reasoning and decision-making technology was mentioned in 2.67% of the studies, while AI-robotics research accounted for 6.43% of the studies.

3.3 Overview of Disease Areas in AI-Related Trials:
- AI-related trials covered 24 disease areas, with the most common areas being neoplasms (24.92%), circulatory system diseases (12.97%), and nervous system diseases (11.51%).
- 4.20% of the trials involved COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 condition studies.

3.4 Overview of Healthcare Application Scenarios in AI-Related Trials:
- The most focused healthcare application scenarios were disease diagnosis and screening (38.38%), medical imaging (21.16%), and clinical outcome prediction (17.16%).
- Other scenarios included patient monitoring and management, clinical decision support, adjuvant treatment, surgery, and rehabilitation.

3.5 Construction of AI Technology Application Graph:
- An AI technology application graph was constructed to visualize the application status of AI technology in different healthcare scenarios and disease areas.
- Deep Learning (DL) technology was found to be applied in various healthcare scenarios, particularly in the diagnosis and screening field.
4. Discussion
4.1 Characteristics of AI-Related Trials:
- 1725 relevant clinical trials on AI were published on ClinicalTrials.gov up to March 2022.
- The number of trial registrations started increasing in 2016, coinciding with the development of industry 4.0 and the attention to AI technology.
- The United States initiated the most clinical trials (24.35%), followed by China, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada.
- Majority of trials were funded by hospitals, universities, or academic institutions.
- AI-related clinical trials have some drawbacks regarding trial design:
  - Dominated by small single-center trials.
  - Most trials enrolled less than 1000 participants.
  - Observational designs were common, and many were non-prospective studies.
  - A significant proportion of interventional trials were non-randomized and lacked blinded designs.
  - More than 90% of AI-related trials could not be classified into conventional clinical trial staging.

- Poor-quality results reporting in AI-related trials:
  - Only 1.74% of trials reported results on ClinicalTrials.gov.
  - Observational trials had significantly fewer results reported.
  - Factors associated with reporting results: interventional trials with multicenter designs were more likely to publish results.

4.2 Status of AI Application:
- Focus on disease diagnosis and screening using ML, DL, CNNs, and CV technologies.
- High proportion of disease areas: neoplasms, digestive system diseases, and visual system diseases.
- ML, DL, and CV technologies commonly used for lesion recognition and disease classification.
- AI technology has potential for clinical outcome prediction, patient monitoring, and management, and adjunctive treatment.
- ML, RL, and NLP have made achievements in patient remote monitoring, intervention, and health promotion.
- Medical robotics, including chatting robots, rehabilitation training robots, assistive wearable robots, and surgical robots, have been studied for various research purposes.

4.3 Challenges:
- Standardization and privacy security of medical data are fundamental challenges for AI implementation.
- Lack of standardized guidance frameworks for EHR collection and ethical challenges in sharing medical big data.
- Explainability of AI technology is a critical issue for trust and effective management.
- Clinical validation is necessary to demonstrate the impact of AI technology on health outcomes.
- Insufficient number of high-quality prospective clinical trials in the healthcare AI field.

4.4 Limitations:
- The study is based on a subset of AI-related clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov.
- Some trials did not provide detailed information on AI technology used.
- Limited reporting of trial results.
- Challenges in widespread implementation of AI technology require specific regulation and evaluation policies.

Conclusion:
- The number of AI-related trials in healthcare has increased exponentially since 2016.
- Trials are predominantly small single-center studies, and there is a need for more high-quality prospective trials.
- AI technology is primarily focused on disease diagnosis and screening, but there is limited reporting of results.
- Challenges include standardization of medical data, explainability of AI, and clinical validation.
- Further regulation, evaluation policies, and prospective clinical trials are needed for the widespread implementation of AI technology in healthcare.
