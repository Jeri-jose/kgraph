# 📚 Research Findings — Biomedical Knowledge Graph Internship

> 🧠 A curated collection of research notes, domain insights, and conceptual groundwork explored during my internship focused on Biomedical Knowledge Graphs using Neo4j.

---

## 📌 Overview

This folders contains structured notes, Markdown write-ups, and domain-specific research conducted during my internship. These findings directly supported the ontology modeling and graph database development efforts showcased in the main `owltoneo4j/` repository.


---

## 🧪 Themes Covered

- 🧬 Biomedical ontologies and entity design
- 📊 Graph-based knowledge extraction from literature
- 💊 Drug databases and how to model them
- 🔎 Clinical trial data modeling (AICT, CTR)
- 🧩 GraphML formats and visualization strategies
- 📚 Use of PICO (Patient–Intervention–Comparison–Outcome) for structuring biomedical search queries

---

## 🎯 Purpose

These documents serve as:
- Background studies for ontology design
- Domain-specific reasoning for graph schema decisions
- Relationship modeling and biomedical relevance
- Foundation for Cypher logic, queries, and automation
